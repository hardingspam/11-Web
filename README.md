## Project 2

To run this project, start by running the file 'upload_to_database.py'
to clean and load data into server. A print statement with several rows of the
SQLAlchemy database should print. Once this check is complete, run 'app.py' as
a flask application and visit localhost:5000 in your browser. A navigable
webpage should launch. Click through Utilization to see actual Medicare
procedures by service line, and Per Capita to see the procedures per person
(note that 65+ population for the year of observation is used as a stand-in
for actual Medicare enrollment). Please note that, as of now, Over Time is not
an active link.
